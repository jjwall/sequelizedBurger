# burger
Go to localhost:8080/burgers to see full DB of burgers, buttons will redirect where they need to from there

Simple web app that lets you create a burger, eat it, and then throw it away. I use MySQL queries: READ to list out the burgers, CREATE, to be able to make a burger, UPDATE to be able to eat the burger, and DELETE to "throw the wrappers away." Notable technology used is sequelized to model my MySQL database structure.
